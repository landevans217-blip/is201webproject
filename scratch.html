        <h2>About My Hobby</h2>
        <p>Videogames aren't just a form of entertainment or pass time whenever you feel bored, they are a medium by which you can escape the harsh reality of our world and enter a new one, teeming with challenges, immersive stories, complex characters, interesting and fun mechanics/gimmicks, and so much more. The best videogames are those that incorporate an adeqaute amount of high-quality graphics, engaging mechanics, compelling storytelling, among others, to create an unforgettable experience. Videogames also can have, and have had, large impacts on culture and society, influencing trends, fashion, and even politics, for example, the game Fortnite inspired a trend where fans and social media influencers would mimic the game's dances and emotes in real life and post them. Videogames have also been proven to be beneficial in many way like how they can enhance cognitive skills such as attention allocation and visual processing, they can motivate people and make them feel accomplished through achievements and rewards in the game, they can encourage people to be social through chats that happen while playing together, and they can also relieve stress depending on the game and improve moods, and they can even enhance memory in certain cases. While there are many positives, there are also drawbacks like with addiction which can distract from life in an unhealthy way, sleep disruption from playing the game longer than they should, they can cause anxiety and depression depending on the game, and some others. Despite all of these things, videogames are beloved by communities and are cherised for their amazing impacts and the genuine joy one can feel from playing them, which helps the good outweigh the bad.</p>

        <h2>Why I Like It</h2>
        <p>Videogames are timeless for me, I've never not enjoyed playing them, and they've been a huge part of my life in between school and social things. Some days I would even play past 12:00 AM which I admit was quite unhealthy but it just goes to show how much I truly enjoyed these games. Videogames are also what helped me connect with friends that I would continue to have and cherish throughout the rest of my life, meeting one of my friends by playing Roblox and Brawl Stars, another through Fortnite, and so on. I've come to enjoy many games throughout the years from many different genres that I will discuss in the next seciton of this website, but overall, videogames highlight and bring back to light core memories I've had throughout the years, and they genuinely bring me joy whenever I am stressed or troubled with things in life. So, I will continue to enjoy this hobby of mine and find new games to try and immerse myself in each and every time they come out.</p>
