                        <p>My name is Logan Chad Evans and I was born in Carmichael, CA, and eventually moved a few years later to Mesa, AZ, which is where I would spend the rest of my childhood and young adult years, and I am 19 years old currently. I come from a family of eight, my parents and six children consisting of my 2 sisters, 3 brothers, and myself. I've always been pushed to challenge myself academically which is the main reason I hold grades and education in such a high regard. My father is to thank for that, since through his encouragement I did those things, and I can't help but appreciate what he did for me, because I wouldn't be where I am now without him. </p>
                        <p>I am also a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, where I found a testimony of Christ and God, and their love toward us that knows no bounds. That testimony ended up being one of the main reasons I decided to study at Brigham Young University, since I wanted to be a part of the Christlike environment there. I am even going to dedicate two years of my life in service of the Lord soon, as I head off to serve a mission in Piracicaba, Brazil.</p>
                        <p>My major so far studying at BYU is Pre-Business, which I hope will either lead me into Finance, Accounting, or Information Systems.</p>
